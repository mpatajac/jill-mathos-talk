- variables, functions
- immutable variables
- no loops
- types
- tail-call optimization
 
</v-clicks>

<!-- 

most of the stuff was straight-forward


- [click] variables, functions (like in Jack) 
- [click] immutable variables (just don't implement mutation) 
- [click] no loops (just don't add them) 
- [click] types (ctor functions, tagged unions) 
- [click] tail call (first idea worked, tough execution)

[click:5]

- difficult at best
- lots of instructions (bad for Hack)
- can't work if we don't know all used fns

# Take 3: 

## dynamic dispatch

```
if fid == 0 then
	call Int.min 2

	call Int.max 2

else if fid == 2 then
	call Bool.and 2

else if fid == 3 then
	call Bool.not 1

	. . .
```

<!-- 

- each fn represented with a fid => enables dyn call
- limited to 1-arity fns (or multiple dispatchers)
- can't capture data when returning fn from fn

 -->

---

# Take 4: 

## dynamic dispatch + closure


<!-- 

- closure with fid + captures (and more)
- solves problem with returning fn
- save fn arity => multi-arg dispatch from single dispatcher
